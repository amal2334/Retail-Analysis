This project focuses on analyzing a retail dataset to uncover valuable business insights, build a customer segmentation model, and create a basic product recommendation system. The goal is to help businesses understand customer behavior, improve marketing strategies, and enhance sales performance.

Objective
To explore and analyze retail customer data, answer key business questions, segment customers using machine learning, and recommend products that match customer interests.

Project Steps
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Checked for missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.

Processed categorical variables and formatted the data for analysis.

Prepared the dataset for exploratory analysis and modeling.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
I explored the dataset to answer key business questions, such as:

Product popularity vs. customer satisfaction by category.

Top-rated product categories by average review score.

Promo code usage by gender and age group.

Customer preferences for shipping methods.

Seasonal trends in product category purchases.

Total revenue by product category.

Top revenue-generating regions.

Total purchase amount by gender.

Total spending by age group.

Distribution of payment methods used by customers.

Customer purchase amounts by discount status.

Purchase frequency by subscription status.

Most profitable product categories.

Distribution of product categories.

Top most valuable customers ranked by engagement.

Customer purchase frequency distribution, with recommended actions for each segment.

3. Customer Segmentation Model
I built a Customer Segmentation model using machine learning techniques (KMeans Clustering).
The model groups customers based on their purchase behavior, spending habits, and engagement levels.
These segments help businesses:

Identify high-value customers.

Target marketing campaigns effectively.

Understand customer needs based on segment profiles.

4. Product Recommendation System
I developed a simple recommendation system that suggests products to customers based on their previous purchases and preferences.

5. Data Visualization
I used various plots and charts (bar plots, pie charts, heatmaps, etc.) to clearly present insights for both technical and non-technical audiences.

Tools and Libraries Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

What I Learned
This project helped me:

Ask the right business questions before diving into data.

Clean, preprocess, and explore real-world data effectively.

Visualize data insights clearly.

Build a customer segmentation model to group customers.

Develop a basic recommendation system.

Present findings in a simple, understandable way for stakeholders.
